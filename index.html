    <p>Nice to meet you! I consider myself an ambitious person, let's go back to the start of my journey, through my greatest accomplishments to becoming who I am now!</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">MUSICAL BEGINNINGS (2013-2017)</h2>
    <p>I was never the best in school, but I always had a love for the arts. One of my first accomplishments was performing excellently on trumpet and in band overall. Our marching band, jazz band, and concert band all won many competitions with me involved. I've made it to the district jazz, and concert band. And I played in the Pearl Harbor Memorial Parade in 2014. At the young age of 12-15 this endeavor required a serious amount of dedication and practice.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">HICKORY NUT GAP FARM (2010-2020)</h2>
    <p>While growing up I spent a lot of time at Hickory Nut Gap Farm in Asheville, NC.<br>
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hickorynutgap/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/hickorynutgap/</a></p>
    
    <p>While growing up here I learned a lot about hard work, farm labor, horse caretaking, general handyman activities, organic farming, and organic meat procurement. One of the farm's main businesses is Hickory Nut Gap Meats. Not only did I have fun growing up here, it instilled working hard and in the sun into my bones. One of my dreams in life is to have my own farm one day. Just the fact that I was a hard-working child on a farm is one of my greatest accomplishments.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">BUSINESS & ENTREPRENEURSHIP (2017-2021)</h2>
    <p>As I grew older, my ambition started to grow a little big for my shoes, and I decided that I need to raise a lot of capital to become a business owner of any kind. To hire and lead people to push the envelope of innovation and technology. I have never been one to want to rely on connections or networking, quite a grand mistake of mine. But each lesson taught me more and more. I decided the best way to raise capital quickly would be through illicit drug trades. At the age of 16 I embarked on a journey into the underground. I would not be complacent and lazy. I did everything in my power to mitigate risk, a lot of this also has to do with logistics. Risk management and how the business is run go hand in hand. Even though this is one of my accomplishments it is always a mistake to go against the government. Over the next 3 years from 2017-2020 I increased revenue x10. I worked 10-12 hour days. And even started scaling and hiring employees. When Covid happened a shift started to take place. I had prior connections in California, and started making deals moving vast amounts of marijuana across the country. Subsequently I was arrested in October, 2020 with 20 pounds of marijuana in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma. Although I wasn't stressed one bit, there is nothing I fear in this world. It just signified a great change in my personal life and personality.</p>
    
    <p>Currently I am still on 5 year probation, I will be expunged of these charges in April 2026.</p>
    
    <p>This also goes hand in hand with another small accomplishment at the same time. I truly embodied the culture and personality of a "drug dealer". I taught myself how to make music, recording rap songs as it was the most popular and easy to understand music at the time. As my business grew my music got better and I started to become a popular local musician performing multiple local shows. Selling out one of the more popular venues in Asheville, NC where I grew up.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">CULINARY WORK & CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT (2021-2024)</h2>
    <p>Once my time on probation started, jobs weren't so easy to come by. I started becoming a chef working in local kitchens. This time wasn't wasted one bit. I educated myself in every way possible. Everyone is the Chef of their own kitchen in life, long nights and doubles in the kitchen taught me patience, resilience, and most importantly how to be efficient.</p>
    
    <p>In my free time I taught myself everything about FL Studio Digital Audio Workspace (DAW). This was in line with my previous efforts to become a musician. While I did have a passion for art and music my main reason for doing anything is to raise capital, and exponentially grow whatever it is that I'm working on.</p>
    
    <p>Honestly nothing much happened during this period, I learned a lot and floated around, Doubts started to creep in at this time. I tried my hand at TikTok and promoted my music there. I had some success but it was never enough to rationalize putting that much effort into art.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">MEOW TERMINAL & CREATIVE PROJECTS (2025-PRESENT)</h2>
    <p>This brings me to my recent developments, starting in 2025 I noticed how many advancements were being made in AI. I have always been a technical person, but to an extent. I am a generalist that can understand lots of different industries. I was also trading stocks at the time, so I decided that with little coding knowledge I would try to bring the mystical world of quantitative data to me. I created Meow Terminal.</p>
    
    <p>Meow Terminal uses many financial algorithms, machine learning, and the Black-Scholes model.</p>
    
    <p>I have grown my social accounts a little bit, showing the building process of Meow Terminal. And promoting the utility of the application to give the user predictive price forecasts on assets with a confidence interval.</p>
    
    <p>I was contacted by the founder of ModeNetwork (<a href="https://www.mode.network/" target="_blank">https://www.mode.network/</a>) to talk about predictive modeling for financial assets. And I am still working on this project currently. Meow Terminal has been growing exponentially, I am excited to be working on something with so much utility that also pushes the envelope of what's possible. I even implemented my own creative ideas that I've never seen such as the 3D calendar tower graph. This graph can help users spot trends on each trading day of the month.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">GRIND WITH GRATITUDE (2025-PRESENT)</h2>
    <p>Now I am currently working with "Grind with Gratitude" a local North Carolina beverage company that provides bottled water, and THC seltzers. To be able to get into this company at such an early time (2 months after inception) and do work as a Tech & Sales Consultant is one of my greatest accomplishments. To have the owners recognize my skills and talent without a lot of prior experience in tech fields. I have a personal TikTok with the company where I promote and market the beverages. I'm involved with all the related tech including website building, POS systems, and marketing. I visit Bars, Restaurants, and other locations for B2B Sales. And I also do direct sales work in the Total Wine stores of Charlotte, NC.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">PERSONAL REFLECTIONS</h2>
    <p>Most of all my greatest accomplishment is that I'm still standing, I'm healthy and happy.</p>
    
    <p>That's what's most important in life to me.</p>
